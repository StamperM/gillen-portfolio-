            <p id="aboutP">For the past five years I have been working with Software engineers 
                in the role of a project manager. I am good with working with others
                and have been the bridge between engineers and business. During this 
                time I have built a great great relationships and have helped improve 
                lines of communication and put several process in place to help get better 
                estimates and help my teams meet their deadlines.
